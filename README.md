# pyAPisolation
This package facilitates batch feature extraction and data dashboarding of ABF files. Primarily written for Inoue Lab @ western university. The package is able to output feature arrays and/or raw current traces from the file(s). The module piggy backs off of some of the excellent work found in the pyABF & ipfx packages.
